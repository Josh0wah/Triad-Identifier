# Triad-Identifier
Takes 3 musical notes as input, and identifies the chord they make.

As of right now:
Notes must be entered in ascending order storting from the root
Only triads are supported (full chord identification will be implimented later)
Program can identify triads as major, minor, sus2, sus4, diminished, or augmented
